**BACKSTORY**

In November 2020, on Twitter, [**Jhey threw a challenge**](https://twitter.com/jh3yy/status/1322512013747126274) to fellow CSS artists to create **No DIV CSS arts**. He called it the **#nodivember** challenge. When some creators, including [**Manaswini**](https://twitter.com/thisismanaswini), started submitting their creations, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to hone my CSS skills and do something I never did.

So, let me introduce you to **Arduino UNO with LCD Display with blink and marquee animation**, my first attempt at No DIV CSS art creation! I was on cloud nine when it made it to [**Week #2 of #nodivember.**](https://twitter.com/jh3yy/status/1328398498748837890)

**FUN FACTS**

-   Came to know about **#nodivember** on 7th November and I was already late for [**Week #1**](https://twitter.com/jh3yy/status/1325440333161918465). Took so much time deciding what to build that I had only two days before Week #2 ends. I kind of rushed to complete it and wrote this longest piece of stylesheet.

-   Took me **19 hours** to put this all together. Yes, that's nearly a whole day!

-   It was my first **responsive** CSS creation (Responsiveness was pretty new to me back then)

-   Someone on Twitter asked me how many gradients were needed to create this. I wasn't sure, so I counted all **487 CSS gradients.**

-   Edge was not as efficient at rendering CSS as it is today. It was safe to assume that it won't work. But it did! (except the animation)

-   After two years, this is the most hearted pen of my CodePen profile!
